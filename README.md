# Welcome to My Cool Webpage!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is a fun project I made â€“ it's a simple web page with a signup form that checks if your email has the '@' symbol.

## What's Inside?

- **Form Validation**: It's like a double-check. Before you hit submit, it makes sure your email has that '@' thingy.
- **Simple Look**: Nothing fancy, just a cool form to fill in!

## Tech Stuff I Used

- HTML: The basic stuff you see on websites.
- CSS: Makes everything look nice.
- JavaScript: The magic behind the form check!

## How to Try It Out

1. Clone this thing: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-cool-webpage.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## How It Works

- `index.html`: The actual webpage stuff.
- `styles.css`: Makes things pretty.
- `script.js`: Checks the '@' thing in your email.

## Usage Tips

1. Fill in the form with your username, email, and password.
2. If your email is missing the '@' symbol, a little alert will remind you!
